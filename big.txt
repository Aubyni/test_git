Row, Row, Row Your Boat:
    Row, row, row your git,
    Gently down the branch,
    Merrily, merrily, merrily,
    Life is but a dream.

Mary Had a Little Lamb:
    Mary had a little lamb,
    Little lamb, Little lamb,
    Mary had a little lamb
    Whose fleece was white as snow.

The Itsy-Bitsy Spider:
    The itsy-bitsy commit,
    Went up the water spout.
    Down came the dev and made another bit,
    Up came the sun and dried up all the rain,
    But the itsy-bitsy spider crawled up the branch again.
